GUI Design Continued:
Form and function
	Good form: looks pleaseing, inviting
	Good function: works well, robustly, and is caple
Well designed GUIs have both form and function

Remember CRAP!
	Contrast
	Recognition
	Appearance
	Proximity

Fonts
	Concordant
		one font, or family, or 2+ similar
		calm, formal
	Disconcordanmt
		2+ fonts
		energized and formal

Establish a visual hierachy
	people see graphics then text
	balance, organization and visual contrast are vital
Direct the reader's eye
	people scan text left to right, top to bottom
	only the top four inches may be visible
	use pastel shades for backgrounds for minor elements
Beware of distractions
	garish illustration and (especially) animated graphics or blinking text pull the user's eyes away from the content
	If everything is emphasized, nothing is emphasized
Be consistent
	dont have things scattered all over your page
	let your style "evolve" as you improve the page

Use white, you do not have to fill everything

We are trying to achieve a correct mental model so users can look at something and interact well with it

Mental model-- a representation of how somethingswill work inside the users mind
	user mental model are what the user thinks is true and is not true
	errors can hinder end user

if your device does not fit the mental model that a user has for it, user will often get frustrated and stop using your product

visibility is one of the biggest factor in design!
	natural signals that are interepretted and lead to natural design

Reasoning and problem solving
	studies reveal that people are often not very logical about the decisions they make
	Deductive reasoing
		top down, start with theory about situation
	Inductive: Bottom up
		derive likely general hypothesis from pattern of specific observations
	
	Confirmation bias and selective thinking
		Selective thinking is the process whereby one selects out favorable evidence for remembrance and foxus wile ignoring unfavorable evidence for a belief
	Framing effect
		positive framining effects ( associated with risk aversion) result from presenation of options as sure (or absolute gains)
		negative framing effects (associated with a preference shift toward choosing riskier options) result from options presented as the relative likelihood of losses
	Decision making
		normative decision models -optimal, rational
			concerned with identifying the best decision to take
				assuming an ideal decision maker
				who is fully informed
				able to compute with perfect acuracy
				and fully rational
		satisficing-find acceptable alternative given limited time and cognitive capacity
			decide on and pursue a course of action satisfying the minimum requirements to achieve a goal
		heuristics -efficient, but potentially biased rules for decision-making
		naturalistic -decision making

Mental Models -- Gulf of evaluation --how do you move someone to different types of models
	Class Exercise:
		the rooster is to the rightt of the microphone
		the fuit is to the right of the rooster
		the child is in front of the fruit
		the pig is in front of the microphone

		Is the pig to the right or left of the child

	P		C

Rule-based Reasoning
	Heuristic = rule of thumb to avoid long decision-making process
		availability
		anchoring - inital thoughts --> final decision
		representativeness - sterotype
		hill climbing - decisions move closer to goal
		problem reduction/decomposition
		used in artifical intelligence programming
	when using heuristics
		attending to limited number of cues
		emphasize first cues and most salient cues
		inattention to later cues
		assume equal reliability of cues
		fixating on initial hypothesis and feeback

Avaliability Heuristic

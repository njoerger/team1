Focus groups:
Goal is to obtain information that is not guided by you, uneditied feedback about your product/application in a small group of around 6-9 people

There are no dumb things to say in focus groups, any bit of information could pay off for your development process in the long run!

You can start with loosing tying it to your idea, start conversation with a low key question.
Ex. sometimes it is hard to get food on campus. have you had this issue.

Would be extra sauce, recorded and transcribed

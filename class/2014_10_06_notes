Task Analysis
	technique
	List tasks to be carried out
		what are the "have to have" which are important, which are low level
	Lists actions user carries out in performing a task
		what does a user do to do a task related to our application
			how to order food
			how do order food/search
	Things user does, acts upon, needs to know to copmlete the task
	focus on the user
	Focus on interaction that user has with the system

What is a task analysis?
	An Analysis of how typical users perform a specific task
	What is  a hierarical task analysis (HTA)?
		a top to bottom task analysius that shows how the tasks are related
	list tasks to be carried out
	lists actions user carries out in performing a task
	things user does, acts upon or needs to know

	Display the results
		idented list (preferred for this class)
		flow chart
What is task analysis good for?
	improves design of tools or procedures used to accomplish goal
	making predictions how long a goal will take to accomplish
	spotting potential errors in the procedure
	spotting ui features that have been ov erlooked or oversimplified

Source of data
	Documentation about the task
		how has the task been done historically
		with other applications
		observe people /debrief after
	Observation
		talk through the process
			how did you know to click or save at this point
	Talk to people

Data Collection
	Gather the information about the task
	organize the information into categories
	many ways to organize and model tasks

use of flow chart (color, symbols, decision tools)

HTA is used to 
	task decomposition
	split into subtasks - subdivision no longer needed
	plans to describe order and conditions
		if then, or and,
	text and diagram

Plans
	explanation for each step
		fixed sequence -parts always done
		choice
		waiting for events
		cycles - repetion
		time-sharing -done at same time
		discreationary
		usually a mixture
	Start and stop
